\chapter{Abstract}
The needs in the fields of biology, microbiology and medicine are in constant evolution. The motivation of our bachelor thesis will be to contribute to this edifice by designing a tool capable or allowing not only to detect particles present in a video, but also to provide an optimal graphical interface for the evaluation of results. This work could therefore serve as a foundation stone for many others in this same field.
